## Question 5
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>I tried the question with an online model which uses CNN.</li>
    <li>The code available wasn't free of bugs.</li>
    <li>The training took around 3 hours.</li>
    <li>The testing was supposed to be live time feed but I tweaked it to read images from my system and predict.</li>
    <li>Due to time constraint I was able to do the classification part only.</li>
    <li>Now that the classification is ready we can integrate the detection part with the code and the traffic sign detection is ready</li>
    <li>Accuracy is 0.9737 for the model</li>
