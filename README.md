Worked as a project member in Team Envisage, CFI </br></br>
**Current PORs:** </br>
Saathi coordinator </br></br>
**Why I want to work in the team:**</br>
I obviously think this is the best team for me as Abhiyaan has a very specific software module. I am deeply interested in how autonomous cars work and want to be a part of the team which is participating in competitions related to ot. I will surely give my best if given an oppurtunity</br></br>

## Question 1
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>I installed Ubuntu 20.04 and ros noetic on a virtual machine</li>
    <li>Reference - <a href="https://youtu.be/x5MhydijWmc">Programming Knowledge</a>,<a href="https://youtu.be/ZEfh7NxLMxA"> Moster</a>
  </ul>
</div>

## Question 2
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>I created the necessary nodes in python as well as c++</li>
    <li>My python nodes worked succesfully</li>
    <li>I have also included the c++ nodes which had some build issues</li>

  </ul>
</div>

## Question 3
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>I have my killer turtle and prey turtle ready</li>
    <li>I did the program in a single node</li>
    <li>Due to time constraint I couldn't finish subtask 2</li>
    <li>The first part of subtask 2 can easily be extracted from my code since at any time I can find the distance between Netero and Hisoka</li>
    <li>Drive link for my catkin ws <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16xrrYGpMTu0TCHsovQ5Wj2mgFlpHeUTU?usp=share_link">Q3</a></li>
    <li>Noticed a bug at the last minute which kills Hisoka sometimes at the start. Will correct it in the coming days</li>
    <li>Reference <a href="https://youtu.be/D7ISrmszozk"> Anis Koubaa</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Question 5
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>I tried the question with an online model which uses CNN.</li>
    <li>The code available wasn't free of bugs.</li>
    <li>The training took around 3 hours.</li>
    <li>The testing was supposed to be live time feed but I tweaked it to read images from my system and predict.</li>
    <li>Due to time constraint I was able to do the classification part only.</li>
    <li>Now that the classification is ready we can integrate the detection part with the code and the traffic sign detection is ready</li>
    <li>Accuracy is 0.9737 for the model</li>

  </ul>
</div>

## Question 6
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>I couldn't complete task 6 but here is my approach</li>
    <li>For tracking,velocity and accelaration we can use a bounding box around the circle using opencv</li>
    <li>I think all the data can be logged in from this information</li>
    <li>For multiple people/circles we can use multiple bounding boxes with labelling</li>
  </ul>
